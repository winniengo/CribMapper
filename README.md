CribMapper is a full-stack web project inspired by apartment finder site [PadMapper](https://www.padmapper.com). It is built with a 

+ Ruby on Rails backend, 
+ a PostgresSQL database, 
+ and a ReactJS/Redux frontend.

The two most important things to look for when shopping for a new apartment on Craigslist are price and location. Like its inspiration, CribMapper maps apartment listings on a Google Map for an convenient beautiful at-a-glance look at available offerings. It offers basic filtering based on price, bedrooms, and bathrooms; and advance filtering on pets, available parking and broker fees. Users can save easily their favorite listings and revisit them.
